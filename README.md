## Precautions

- **Modify Cloudflare->SSL/TLS->Overview->Full**
- **Cloudflare ---> The cloud analyzed by the A record must be gray [if it is not gray, it will affect the automatic renewal of the certificate for the scheduled task]**
- **If you use CDN and use direct connection at the same time, close the cloud + self-selected IP, and refer to the [Cloudflare optimization plan] above for the self-selected IP (https://github.com/mack-a/v2ray-agent/blob/master/documents /optimize_V2Ray.md)**
- **Install with a clean system, if you have installed with other scripts and cannot modify the error yourself, please reinstall the system and try to install again**
- wget: command not found [**Here you need to manually install wget**]
   , if you have not used Linux, [click to view] (https://github.com/mack-a/v2ray-agent/tree/master/documents/install_tools.md) installation tutorial
- Does not support non-root accounts
- **If you find Nginx-related problems, please uninstall the self-compiled nginx or reinstall the system**
- **In order to save time, please bring detailed screenshots or follow the template specifications for feedback. Issues without screenshots or not following the specifications will be closed directly**
- **Not recommended for GCP users**
- **Centos and lower version systems are not recommended. If Centos installation fails, please switch to Debian10 and try again. The script no longer supports Centos6, Ubuntu 16.x**
- **[If you don’t understand the use, please check the script usage guide first](https://github.com/mack-a/v2ray-agent/blob/master/documents/how_to_use.md)**
- **Oracle Cloud has an additional firewall that needs to be set manually**
- **Oracle Cloud only supports Ubuntu**
- **If you use gRPC to forward through cloudflare, you need to allow gRPC in cloudflare, path: cloudflare Network->gRPC**
- **gRPC is currently in beta and may not be compatible with the client you are using, please ignore if it cannot be used**
- **The problem that the low version script cannot be started when the high version is upgraded, [please click this link to view the solution](https://github.com/mack-a/v2ray-agent/blob/master/documents/how_to_use.md# 4%E4%BD%8E%E7%89%88%E6%9C%AC%E5%8D%87%E7%BA%A7%E9%AB%98%E7%89%88%E6%9C%AC% E5%90%8E%E6%97%A0%E6%B3%95%E5%90%AF%E5%8A%A8%E6%A0%B8%E5%BF%83)**
